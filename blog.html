                Yahoo did something honorable last week in releasing their <a target="_blank" href="https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=r&did=75">R10 Yahoo
                News Feed dataset</a>, the largest public dataset of its kind ever released. (so went the headlines) At first I was excited that it might provide good patterns
                to follow. Not so much! &nbsp;
                <a aria-controls="20160127" href="#20160127details" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs btn-collapse" role="button" data-toggle="collapse">

                <p>Again, Yahoo deserves praise for doing something admirable here...I think anyway. I can't be sure because Yahoo is restricting access to academic
                    researchers only. I'm certainly <a target="_blank" href="http://tm.durusau.net/?cat=116">not the only independent researcher</a> to find this restriction
                    lame, but that's not the sole complaint.</p>
                <p>Beyond Yahoo's description on their blog, there apparently exists a readme file that provides more technical information, but it's buried in part 1 of this
                    massive download. Having to download a big tarball just to access a tiny readme file is uncool. If there is a detailed schema of the data, that would be
                    worth seeing without too much trouble.</p>
                <p>If technical details aren't forthcoming, at least provide some sample data, which can be totally fake and lawsuit-free. The dataset has to be chunked up
                    anyway for downloading. Hard to imagine that a few laptop-sized chunks couldn't be carved off safely for use by the general public. Even a few examples in
                    text might help to see if the dataset is worth exploring.</p>
                <p>And what about metadata? Starting with metadata about the parts of the download. Let me grab the readme, schema, sample data and metadata in a small
                    package, and <strong>then</strong> start in on big chunks of data.</p>
                <p>And why a big download at all? (as opposed to EBS snapshot or the like?)</p>
                <p>Again, I don't mean impune the fine folks at Yahoo. But I can't help thinking that an archive half the size but twice as open and self-descriptive would
                    have been better.</p>

                There was a <a target="_blank" href="http://qz.com/572338/the-quartz-guide-to-bad-data/">really great post</a> by the staff at
                <a target="_blank" href="http://qz.com">Quartz</a> last month that I missed somehow. It details 43 different ways that your dataset could need fixing.
                Though written from a reporter's perspective, it's a great checklist for anybody working with datasets.

                I love Bootstrap. I love putting together a quick polished UI without having to fight browser quirks. So I reach for Bootstrap, Bootswatch themes, and PNotify
                (Bootstrap-friendly notifications) whenever possible. As I'm usually using these libraries together, why not treat them as a single unit? &nbsp;

                <p>I'm going to have to maintain this "distribution" whether I choose to give it a name or share it. I'll be upgrading and testing those components together as
                    a unit either way. A single bundle would help me in building multiple sites even if it's not a huge help to anybody else. Granted this distribution is
                    arguably lame...it doesn't introduce anything new, just bundles existing code. Should I really bother to share this?</p>
                <p>In my mind, yes. There's no extra cost associated with sharing, especially as GitHub provides public repos for free. I might save somebody a little time. I
                    might have ideas to tweak or customize down the road, making this distribution less generic and more interesting. In a larger sense, this is a precedent
                    for how we intend to participate in the open-source community. Are we contributors, or just lurkers? Let's err toward contributing!</p>

            <p>
                Starting a business has been my quiet dream for a while now. Not for lack of enjoyment in my work in recent years, far from it. My last company (Xaffire) was a
                great ride. We went from tiny startup (20 people) to part of Quest Software (4k people) to part of Dell (>100k people). I grew to love working as part of an
                international team, having the freedom to follow my own research, and representing my group at public events. All this conspired to keep the dream of my own
                business on the back burner...but that couldn't last forever. &nbsp;
                <a aria-controls="20160113" href="#20160113details" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs btn-collapse" role="button" data-toggle="collapse">
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></span>
                </a>
            </p>
            <div class="collapse" id="20160113details">
                <p>Dell is a big company in big transition, and I was laid off (as part of a much larger layoff) in November 2015. It was a bit of a shock initially, but no
                    hard feelings. I have many friends at Dell for whom I wish the best. If this event is what put me on track to owning my own business, I'm grateful for
                    it.</p>
                <p>Obviously a lot has changed in the decade since Xaffire was a startup. Monitoring/logging tools that rely on packet sniffing (like TeaLeaf, Coradiant, and
                    Xaffire) have seen their time in the sun dimmed by surging numbers of cloud deployments. Newer user recording tools (like Clicktale, Inspectlet, and Lucky
                    Orange) are available for customers running in cloud environments. At this point, it is a leap of faith that resurface.io can carve out a distinct niche,
                    but obvious that doing so requires a re-think from first principles.</p>
                <p>So I find myself starting from scratch: without any other contributors, without any inventions or intellectual property, without any intent to violate
                    agreements to my former employer, and without any really firm ideas yet about positioning or implementation or go-to-market strategy. All I have is a
                    domain name, an exceedingly vague tagline, and the drive to explore what comes next. This could be a stroke of genius, or utter folly...but you gotta start
                    somewhere, right?</p>
