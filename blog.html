            <p>
                Starting a business has been my quiet dream for a while now. Not for lack of enjoyment in my work in recent years, far from it. My last company (Xaffire) was a
                great ride. We went from tiny startup (20 people) to part of Quest Software (4k people) to part of Dell (>100k people). I grew to love working as part of an
                international team, having the freedom to follow my own research, and representing my group at public events. All this conspired to keep the dream of my own
                business on the back burner...but that couldn't last forever. &nbsp;
                <a aria-controls="20160113" href="#20160113details" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs btn-collapse" role="button" data-toggle="collapse">
                    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></span>
                </a>
            </p>
            <div class="collapse" id="20160113details">
                <p>Dell is a big company in big transition, and I was laid off (as part of a much larger layoff) in November 2015. It was a bit of a shock initially, but no
                    hard feelings. I have many friends at Dell for whom I wish the best. If this event is what put me on track to owning my own business, I'm grateful for
                    it.</p>
                <p>Obviously a lot has changed in the decade since Xaffire was a startup. Monitoring/logging tools that rely on packet sniffing (like TeaLeaf, Coradiant, and
                    Xaffire) have seen their time in the sun dimmed by surging numbers of cloud deployments. Newer user recording tools (like Clicktale, Inspectlet, and Lucky
                    Orange) are available for customers running in cloud environments. At this point, it is a leap of faith that resurface.io can carve out a distinct niche,
                    but obvious that doing so requires a re-think from first principles.</p>
                <p>So I find myself starting from scratch: without any other contributors, without any inventions or intellectual property, without any intent to violate
                    agreements to my former employer, and without any really firm ideas yet about positioning or implementation or go-to-market strategy. All I have is a
                    domain name, an exceedingly vague tagline, and the drive to explore what comes next. This could be a stroke of genius, or utter folly...but you gotta start
                    somewhere, right?</p>
